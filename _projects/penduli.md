## Rainbow Pendulum project written in haskell
<br>
This was a project I coded for a week 1 challenge in my Haskell course.

The challenge was to simply code the most impressive project using the gloss library.
Having recently watched videos on youtube of those satisfying 2 joint pendulums, I decided to code my own in Haskell
 as it is easy to parallelize in Haskell due to its lack of mutability and side effects.
<br>
This was a project I completed by myself, working in the hours around lectures and using mostly just the source documentation for Gloss.

Looking back at it I would have liked to cleaned up some of the haskell a bit and looked further into the equations
for the accelleration of an individual pendulum, and I'm grateful to a friend who suggested rainbow colours as I think it really achieves
the satisfaction of its source material.
