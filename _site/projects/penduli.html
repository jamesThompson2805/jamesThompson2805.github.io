<p><br />
This was a project I coded for a week 1 challenge in my Haskell course.</p>

<p>The challenge was to simply code the most impressive project using the gloss library.
Having recently watched videos on youtube of those satisfying 2 joint pendulums, I decided to code my own in Haskell
 as it is easy to parallelize in Haskell due to its lack of mutability and side effects.
<br />
This was a project I completed by myself, working in the hours around lectures and using mostly just the source documentation for Gloss.</p>

<p>Looking back at it I would have liked to cleaned up some of the haskell a bit and looked further into the equations
for the accelleration of an individual pendulum, and Iâ€™m grateful to a friend who suggested rainbow colours as I think it really achieves
the satisfaction of its source material.</p>
